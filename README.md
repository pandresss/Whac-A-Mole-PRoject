# Whac-A-Mole-Project-1
What I'm hoping to be a basic and fun project.

This is the readme file.... more stuff to come. 

Name of The Game is Whac-A-Mole. 

Rules of the game are pretty simple. 

Hit as many moles in the alloted time. Get the highest score possible. 

Some of the challenges I expect to encounter would be creating a memory bank 
for the scores. and for the game to end when time runs out. 

Being able to increase speeds of certain moles. 

I'm going to try and implement the same tech  we used in class with our duckHunt lesson and try to apply them in JQuery.
